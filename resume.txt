SUMMARY
Director of Technology and long-time builder with a career across software engineering, infrastructure, and manufacturing. I lead calm, pragmatic teams that deliver Linux and cloud systems, DevOps automation, and resilient ecommerce platforms while decades of Zen practice keep the room steady under pressure. I stay close to the keyboard, understand the whiteboard, and use AI with an eye toward privacy and measurable outcomes.

CURRENT FOCUS
